# MovingTank
Moving an object along the X, Y axes and rotating it in the center

The user can move the image of an object in the screen window in different directions using the arrow keys on the keyboard, and also rotate the object using the A, D keys clockwise/counterclockwise. When rotating an image, the user by default sees a dynamically changing drawing of the rectangle of the object image.
